### Lehigh 2024 Undergraduate Class Composition by Location

![Infographic](https://github.com/EllisKrusch/EllisKrusch.github.io/blob/main/%20Infographic.png?raw=true)

Each year, Lehigh University publishes a university profile consisting of admission data, class demographics, and faculty/staff information. 

The following infographic focuses on the profile [published for fall 2024](https://data.lehigh.edu/sites/data.lehigh.edu/files/LUprofile_2024.pdf). 

The following student class is broken down by location and provides insight into the composition of students at Lehigh, most of whom are from New York/New Jersey. 

### How Effective is NYC's Congestion Pricing System?

![MTA Infographic](https://github.com/EllisKrusch/EllisKrusch.github.io/blob/main/Congestion%20Graphic.png?raw=true)

As a Manhattan native, I was affected by the decision to finally implement the [long-discussed congestion pricing program](https://www.curbed.com/article/new-york-congestion-pricing-start-date-questions.html) at the beginning of 2025. 

I live relatively close to 60th Street, where the pricing was set to begin, and would have to plan my trips to and from school around this. My toll entering Manhattan was usually $16, and if I was to go through the congestion pricing zone, I would sometimes have to pay up to $26 to enter Manhattan. 

Other New Yorkers and I are curious just how effective this congestion pricing program has been, which is why I chose this data set. 

All references to the "Central Business District" in the graph refer to the area in Manhattan located below 60th street, where congestion pricing is applied. 

In designing my infographic, I took the available information from the last 5 months and compared the historical average to the current average. 

The historical average, which I refered to as the historical daily baseline in my graphic, was created through the MTA's [Hub Bound Travel Report](https://www.nymtc.org/en-us/Data-and-Modeling/Transportation-Data-and-Statistics/Publications/Hub-Bound-Travel) and according to the Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) "Daily vehicle volumes from the 2022 report and a pre-release copy of the 2023 report were adjusted to create baselines for each month of the year, accounting for the fact that some have comparatively low (e.g. January, July) and high (e.g. June, October) traffic volumes."

By looking at this visualization of the MTA's data, it's clear that congestion pricing has made a difference in the traffic density of downtown Manhattan. For each of the five months I looked at, the amount of vehicles entering Manhattan daily has been 10%-14% lower than the baseline number. 

All of the data displayed in my infographic was collected by the MTA and displayed on their metrics website. A link to the raw data can be found [here](https://metrics.mta.info/?cbdtp/vehiclereductions). 

### Lehigh vs Lafayette Timeline Visualization Project

This project focuses on the long-standing Lehigh-Lafayette rivalry. The schools are located 17 miles apart in Pennsylvania's Lehigh Valley, and share a deep-seated and passionate history of competition that extends beyond football to all of their athletic contests, according to Wikipedia. The week leading up to the game is marked by a spirited "Rivalry Week" on both campuses, featuring student activities and some traditions. The Lehigh-Lafayette rivalry is a major event for students, alumni, and the surrounding community, and often draws sellout crowds and national media attention.

### Ford Motor Company Timeline Visualization Project

My project focused on the Ford Motor Company because of how innovative and iconic of a brand they are. I'm personally interested in Ford and cars, and they have a really interesting company history. Everything from the assembly line invention to making pickup trucks affordable and available has solidified Ford's worldwide recognition, and I've tried to include as much as possible in my timeline. While Ford could have a very large timeline with how much they have done as a company, I tried to pick iconic and culture-changing moments to include in my timeline.

### NYC TLC Fleet Analysis 

I was curious about how representative hybrid or electric vehicles are in NYC's Taxi/Limousine fleet. As a native New Yorker, I've been in many taxis over my lifetime and have noticed a shift in recent years towards more hybrid vehicles. Many of the yellow taxis I've taken are now Toyota Rav4s or Toyota Siennas, both of which run on hybrid engines. I remember before COVID that many of the taxis were old Ford Crown Victorias or Ford Expeditions, both of which had fairly large and certainly not hybrid gasoline engines. 

Part of this project was also meant to explore the comparison between NYC's yellow/green cab fleet and the for-hire market. There is a stark difference between these fleet sizes (which I've also observed while in the city), of 78,620 for-hire vehicles versus 16,482 cabs (as of 2020). While analyzing this data from the TLC, it was clear that the taxi fleet has been becoming more environmentally friendly than the for-hire fleet of Uber and Lyft drivers. I'm curious to see whether this is still the case today in 2025, but unfortunately, the TLC does not do a breakdown report by hybrid and gas anymore, instead focusing on purely electric vehicles, of which there are minimal in comparison to the full fleet size. 

For reference, while observing my chart below, "Medallion Taxi's" refer to the "iconic" yellow taxi cabs. "Green Street Hail Livery" refers to the fleet of green-painted specialized taxis that may not accept riders south of West 110th St and East 96th St. "For-Hire Services Vehicle" refers to private ride-hailing services such as Uber and Lyft.

### 2019 Top Biking Cities Map

### Top 10 Museums in the World

For this project, I explored what was considered to be the "best" 10 museums around the world. I pulled my information from a National Geographic article that outlined why each destination was chosen and why it was so significant. To view the referenced article and read more, visit the description included on my published map. 

All of these museums hold invaluable and iconic works of art, many of which I learned about when I took art history. While the list is interesting to look at, I think it's especially beneficial to view it on a map. I would like to visit many of these places over my lifetime, and seeing them all shown on a map makes it easier to plan around, depending on where you're vacationing.

### Lehigh University Party Data Visualization

I experimented with the Tableau Public tool for this data visualization. I was curious about how survey responses would vary across class standing and gender. 

For my first chart, I compared how unsafe conditions experienced at an off-campus party varied by gender. It turns out that men report experiencing more unsafe conditions when attending off-campus parties, although only slightly more than women. 

For the second chart, I wanted to see if students of different class standings had different preferences for party locations. I had thought that the lower their class standing (first year, for example), the more likely they would prefer parties on campus. However, first years actually preferred parties at off-campus houses. The only class standing that preferred fraternity houses over off-campus houses for parties was third-year students. 

You can find the complete breakdown of each of these graphs by viewing the interactive dashboard below.
