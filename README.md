## About Me 

I'm Ellis, a Lehigh University journalism major with minors in marketing and earth and environmental science. During the summer, I was a Marketing Intern at Branded Hospitality Ventures, building strategic partnerships with industry-leading brands, supporting podcast production, and developing the company's newsletter. I also have corporate experience as a part-time MondelÄ“z International Sales Support Specialist, the global leader in snacking, home to brands such as Oreo, Ritz, and Sour Patch Kids.

At Lehigh, I am the Deputy News Editor of The Brown and White, the student newspaper, where I contribute to proofreading articles and overseeing staff writers to improve the reporting standard. My background blends strategic partnerships, leadership in content initiatives, and marketing expertise, and I am passionate about driving growth and helping organizations create impactful connections with their audiences.
